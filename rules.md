#We do ~

1. Share and discuss everything about technology.
-opportunities, culture, processes, news, entrepreneurship, maker culture, hackathons, events, anything that's related to technology.

Though we are excited about technology as a whole;
Precisely, anything that computes or has the potential to compute/process/microcontrol code, could easily be the kind of technology we would love to know and talk about.

2. Share all the opportunities and events that come across our way. 
We love to share the treasure links as we move. Just put a one liner description to the links.


3. To help and get helped. It's highly encouraged.
-Post a query and/or help fix other’s. Someone else might be interested  in the same problem, earlier or later.

4. To share links but not discuss about certain things.
-Typical examples could be productivity hacks, life goals, self development, psychology, news, inspiration, politics, etc. Since it's not in our primary interests we only encourage links to be posted with a 1-2 sentence context. We don't encourage discussions, debates or long posts in this special case.

#Guidelines:
1. Do share great content. That we love.
A major reason why some groups lose direction is because they stop sharing great content.
Please share almost every good content about technology that excited you. 
If we keep posting great stuff, someone would think thrice before posting shallow content.
2. Its great to be helped.
Afterall, that's what the community is all about. That comes under the general discussion. And that's encouraged. Prefer to post some links relevant to the discussion. Links can be accessed in group media.

Try moving into personal messaging if it's not a group thing anymore.
Typically, when you stop being relevant to more than 4-5 people.

3. Don’t Bring Up Irrelevant Topics

4. Don’t Send Dubious And Unnecessary Content

5. During a discussion, do keep in mind to keep your content clean, appropriate and more importantly spam-free.

6. Avoid emoticons unless its answering a call or a questions. 

7. This one is a bit tricky: Don’t Message At Unearthly Hours.  
While we can’t predict what our favourite timings might be, we encourage you to refrain posting after around 1-2 am.

8. Think and most of your content as one msg to make minimum notifications.

9. English mainly is our mode of communication. As we have a few members from outside Kerala, we'd prefer not to outcast them.

10. We are open to change, if you find anything oppressing about the group, share it with your 'BEARlead'- the guy who introduced you here.
