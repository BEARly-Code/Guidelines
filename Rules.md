# Purpose of the group

1. Share and discuss any topics related to technology.

2. Share opportunities and events related to technology. 

3. Help each other with problems related to technology.

# Rules

_The main goal is to prevent flooding the members with messages as it makes relevant content hard to find and is irritating._

1. English should be the mode of communication.

2. Share only technology related content.

3. Keep the messages short and to the point.
..One or two lines with a link on the topic/event shared will be enough.

4. Keep your messages clean, appropriate and more importantly spam-free.

5. Keep all discussions short.
..* If a discussion is getting long, please continue the discussion elsewhere.
..* If possible, make use of public forums like StackOverflow and Quora. Ask the questions in a new public forum and share the link to the forum in the group.
..* If you cannot use public forums, ask the question directly in group but keep the discussions short.

_People who consistently violate these rules will be removed from the group._

_We are open to change. If you find anything oppressing about the group, share it with one of the admins._
