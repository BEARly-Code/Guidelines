Keep the discussions short.
If a discussion is getting long, please continue the discussion elsewhere.
If possible, make use of platforms like StackOverflow and Quora. Share the link to the online discusssion page in the group.

_Members who consistently violate these rules will be removed from the group._

_We are open to change. If anything oppressing about the group is found, share it with one of the admins._
