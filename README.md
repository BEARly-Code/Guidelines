# Rules-and-guidelines-for-BEARly-groups
This repository contains the rules that are followed in the groups formed by BEARly on various platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp.



## Purpose of the group

1. Share and discuss any topics related to technology.

2. Share opportunities and events related to technology. 

3. Help each other with problems related to technology.

## Rules

_The main goal is to prevent flooding the members with messages as it makes relevant content hard to find and is irritating._

1. English should be the mode of communication.

2. Share only technology related content.

3. Do not share memes, jokes or any other inappropriate content (other than to convey a point).

_Members who consistently violate these rules will be removed from the group._

_We are open to change. If anything oppressing about the group is found, share it with one of the admins._
